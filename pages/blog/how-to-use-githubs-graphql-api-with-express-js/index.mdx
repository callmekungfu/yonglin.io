## About GraphQL

GraphQL is a data querying language that is strongly typed, introspective, and hierarchal. It acts as an application layer as well as a specification. The Graph in GraphQL refers to a graph structure where nodes define objects (repositories, gists, users, etc.) and edges define relationship between objects. The API traverses and returns application data based on the schema definition, independent of how the data is stored.
