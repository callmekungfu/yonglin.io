GitHub offers a powerful REST based API for developers to get data and integrate with its platform, with API version 4, they also introduced the GitHub GraphQL API. This article will show how you can leverage the power of GitHub GraphQL API in your express application.

## About GraphQL

GraphQL is a data querying language that is **strongly typed, introspective, and hierarchal**. It acts as an application layer as well as a specification. The Graph in GraphQL refers to a graph structure where nodes define objects (repositories, gists, users, etc.) and edges define relationship between objects. The API traverses and returns application data based on the schema definition, independent of how the data is stored.

This allows a much greater level of flexibility and more precise data fetching compared to REST based APIs. In one request you can get the name of all the repositories the user owns and their user profile. For more information about GraphQL and how GitHub uses it, visit their developer page.

## Getting Started

I'm going to omit the basic set up like `npm init` and installing dependencies, and jump right into the code, the dependencies I use can be installed like.

```
npm install express dotenv cors
```

To get started create a js file called `server.js`` with the following content:

```ts
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');

// Configure Environment
require('dotenv').config();

const app = express();
const port = 8080;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.use(cors());

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`[server]: Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Now run `node server.js` to start the server, you should the following in your terminal. Good job! We have a working express server now

> [server]: Server is running at http://localhost:8080

## Making GraphQL Calls

One thing you should note is that GraphQL requests are also sent using the HTTP protocol so any http-speaking libraries you use for REST APIs can be used to form GraphQL calls with a few things in mind:

- The request should be a POST request.
- All requests are handled by a single endpoint: https://api.github.com/graphql
- Authentication is required using _bearer tokens_.

To make graphql requests in express, I recommend using a libary called [graphql-request](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request), to install the library:

```
npm install graphql-request graphql
# if you use yarn
yarn add graphql-request graphql
```

You can use the library inline, or you can create a separate reusable module for all of your GraphQL calls.

## Authenticating with GitHub GraphQL

To access the API, you need to have a personal access token, you can obtain one by going to your settings page and developer settings. Make sure to copy your token before leaving the page because you cannot see the token anymore after.

When creating the token, you are prompted to select the permissions for the token, choose what is necessary for your application, [see this page for more details](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Now we can add the GraphQL client to the server:

```ts
const g = require('graphql-request');
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');

// Configure Environment
require('dotenv').config();

const app = express();
const port = 8080;
const url = 'https://api.github.com/graphql';

// Do not have your token in a string in your code, especially if you use source control
// https://medium.com/codait/environment-variables-or-keeping-your-secrets-secret-in-a-node-js-app-99019dfff716
const TOKEN = 'PUT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE';
// Create the graphQL client
const graphQLClient = new g.GraphQLClient(url, {
  headers: {
    authorization: `Bearer ${TOKEN}`,
  },
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.use(cors());

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`[server]: Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

We are one step closer to getting graphQL working on our server, let's test this out by creating an endpoint that gets your profile information from GitHub!

```ts
const g = require('graphql-request');
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');

const { GraphQLClient, gql } = g;

// Configure Environment
require('dotenv').config();

const app = express();
const port = 8080;
const url = 'https://api.github.com/graphql';

// Do not have your token in a string in your code, especially if you use source control
// https://medium.com/codait/environment-variables-or-keeping-your-secrets-secret-in-a-node-js-app-99019dfff716
const TOKEN = 'PUT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE';
// Create the graphQL client
const graphQLClient = new GraphQLClient(url, {
  headers: {
    authorization: `Bearer ${TOKEN}`,
  },
});

app.use(cors());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.get('/github-profile', async (req, res) => {
  // The query that gets profile information
  const query = gql`
    {
      viewer {
        login
        name
        company
        url
        bio
      }
    }
  `;
  // Make Graphql call
  const githubRes = await graphQLClient.request(query);
  // Respond with results
  res.json(githubRes);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`[server]: Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

If you visit http://localhost:8080/github-profile, you should be able to see a json with your user profile info!

**Tada! We have integrated our application with GitHub! Now the possibility is limitless!**
